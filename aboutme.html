  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p> I'm a Junior at Warren Central Highschool and am 16 years old. I've loved everything about computers for as long as I can remember. The first thing I ever had to play games on was a computer, and that was back before elementary school if I can remember correctly. I'd like to get a job in some sort of programming, and this HTML course has made me consider becoming a web designer.</p>
